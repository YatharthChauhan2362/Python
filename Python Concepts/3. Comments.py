# Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to execute.
# Comments can be written to mark the author's name, date when the program is written, adding notes for your future self, etc.

# -> Comments are used to make the code more understandable for the programmer.
# -> The Interpreter does not execute comments.

# There are two types of comments in Python Language -:

# -> Single Line Comment
# -> Multi-Line Comment

# Single Line Comment: Single Line comments are the comments which are written in a single line, i.e., they occupy the space of a single line.
# We use # (hash/pound to write single-line comments).
# An example of a multi-line comment is shown below:
# it is a single liine comment

# Multi-Line Comment: Multi-Line comments are the comments which are created by using multiple lines, i.e., they occupy more than one line in a program.
# We use ' ' '….. Comment ….' ' ' for writing multi-line comments in Python (Use lines enclosed with three quotes for writing multi-line comments).
# An example of a multi-line comment is shown below:
''' It is a multiline Comment'''
