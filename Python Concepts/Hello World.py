# Writing Our First Python Program

# We will be writing our first program in Python Language.
# Let's get to business and start writing our first python program.

# Follow the below steps:

# Open Pycharm and create a new file in it.
# Keep in mind the file name should not match any module name.
# After creating a new file, type:
# print("Hello World")
# Now run your program.
# You will get the output as "Hello World" in your terminal.

# So, this is our first python program, and in this program, we just used the print function.
# In this function, whatever we pass in parenthesis () in a double quote or single quote gets printed (as it is ) in the terminal.

# Make sure you have written and executed the below code to get a feel of what it looks like!

print("Hello world! I am Yatharth Chauhan")
