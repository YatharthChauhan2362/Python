# -> Python Print() Statement:
# print() is a function in Python that allows us to display whatever is written inside it. In case an operation is supplied to print, the value of the expression after the evaluation is printed in the terminal. For example,

# print statement for printing strings
print("I'm Yatharth Chauhan")

# Print statement with a literal
print(20-1)

# This will print "I'm Yatharth Chauhan"" and 30 on the screen respectively!


# -> end: end argument allows us to put something at the end of the line after it is printed.
# In simple words, it allows us to continue the line with " " or ',' or anything we want to put inside these quotes of the end.

# It simply joins two different print statements using some string or even by space.
# Example:

# print statement for printing strings
print("Hey,", end=" This is Yatharth Chauhan")
