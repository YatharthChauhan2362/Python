# Escape Sequences:
# An Escape Sequence character in Python is a sequence of characters that represents a single character.
# It doesn't represent itself when used inside string literal or character.
# It is composed of two or more characters starting with backslash \ but acts as a single character. Example \n depicts a new line character.
